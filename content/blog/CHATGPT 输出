Synchronized Combustion and NVH Measurements on an Engine Test Bench
====================================================================

The article discusses a project at the University of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt, where they sought to simplify the process of measuring vibration and noise in car design, specifically focusing on the powertrain's impact. The challenge was to streamline the measurement process and gain valuable training capacity. Dewesoft's solution was used to establish synchronized measurement with direct visualization as a standard approach, reducing the need for multiple measurement systems and time-consuming post-processing.

The Dewesoft solution allowed for the collection of various data types in a single file, which could then be analyzed and optimized in any software. This approach was particularly beneficial for OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and others designing or verifying more than a single component, as it addressed the challenges of synchronization and immediate visualization.

The article also delves into the specifics of the setup used for the tests, including the hardware and software configurations, and the types of tests conducted. The Dewesoft approach simplified the data acquisition process and required no adjustments in the established analysis process, proving to be a versatile solution for both mobile tests and testbed setups.
